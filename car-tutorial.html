            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Maintaining your car's engine is crucial to ensuring its longevity, performance, and overall safety. Regular upkeep can save you costly repairs and prevent engine breakdowns. In this tutorial, we’ll walk you through essential steps to keep your engine in top condition.</p>

            <h3>1. Regularly Change the Engine Oil</h3>
            <p>One of the most important aspects of car engine maintenance is keeping the oil clean and topped up. Dirty or low oil can cause friction and damage to the engine’s moving parts. Follow your car’s manual for the recommended oil change intervals.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Check the oil level regularly using the dipstick.</li>
                <li>Use the recommended oil type for your vehicle’s engine.</li>
                <li>Change the oil and oil filter as per the manufacturer’s schedule.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Replace the Air Filter</h3>
            <p>A clogged air filter can restrict airflow to the engine, reducing its efficiency and performance. Replacing the air filter is a quick and inexpensive way to keep your engine running smoothly.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Inspect the air filter every 12,000 to 15,000 miles.</li>
                <li>If you drive in dusty or polluted areas, consider replacing it more frequently.</li>
                <li>A clean air filter improves fuel efficiency and engine performance.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Check and Maintain the Cooling System</h3>
            <p>Your engine needs to stay cool to function properly. A malfunctioning cooling system can lead to overheating, which can cause serious engine damage. It’s essential to check the coolant levels regularly and replace it as needed.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Check the coolant level and top it off if necessary.</li>
                <li>Flush the radiator and replace the coolant every 2 years or as specified by the manufacturer.</li>
                <li>Inspect the hoses and radiator for leaks or cracks.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Inspect the Spark Plugs</h3>
            <p>Spark plugs are essential for the engine's ignition process. Over time, spark plugs can wear out, leading to misfires, poor fuel efficiency, and difficulty starting the engine. Regular inspection and replacement can help keep your engine running smoothly.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Inspect the spark plugs every 30,000 miles.</li>
                <li>Replace them if they show signs of wear, such as corrosion or carbon buildup.</li>
                <li>Use spark plugs that match the specifications for your vehicle’s engine.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5. Keep the Timing Belt in Good Condition</h3>
            <p>The timing belt keeps the engine's camshaft and crankshaft in sync, ensuring proper engine timing. A broken timing belt can cause catastrophic engine failure. Regular inspection is crucial to avoid unexpected breakdowns.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Inspect the timing belt for cracks, fraying, or excessive wear.</li>
                <li>Replace the timing belt every 60,000 to 100,000 miles, depending on your vehicle's make and model.</li>
                <li>Consult the owner’s manual for the timing belt replacement schedule.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Maintaining your car’s engine doesn’t have to be complicated. By following these simple steps, you can ensure your engine runs smoothly and lasts longer. Regular maintenance not only saves you money in the long run but also keeps your car performing at its best.</p>
